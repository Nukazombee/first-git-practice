        <p>Cyber junkers are a class that specializes in scavenging, repurposing, and 
          hacking technology in a postapocalyptic world. They have a deep knowledge 
          of how technology works and are able to salvage useful parts and equipment 
          from the ruins of the old world. They are skilled at modifying and upgrading
           technology to suit their needs, and may even be able to build new devices 
           from scratch. In combat, cyber junkers are able to use their technical expertise 
           to disable or hack enemy equipment, giving them an advantage on the battlefield. 
           They may also be able to use their hacking skills to gather information and 
           gain access to otherwise secure systems. This class is well-suited for players 
           who enjoy using their technical skills to overcome challenges and shape 
           the world around them.</p>

           in these harsh environments. They may be resistant to radiation sickness 
           and other negative effects of exposure, and may even be able to harness the 
           power of radiation to their advantage. In combat, rad mutants may have physical 
           enhancements such as increased strength, speed, or durability, making them
            formidable opponents. They may also have special abilities such as energy 
            attacks or the ability to control radiation. This class is well-suited for

  <div class="parent">
    <div class="child">The world as we knew it had come to an end. The skies were filled with ash and the air was thick with the smell of smoke and death. The once great cities lay in ruins, their towering skyscrapers nothing more than twisted metal and broken glass.

      The survivors of the apocalypse huddled in small communities, struggling to survive in a world that had become a wasteland. They lived in makeshift shelters and scavenged for whatever scraps they could find, always on the lookout for danger.
      
      In this post-apocalyptic world, the strong preyed on the weak and only the fittest could hope to survive. Gangs roamed the land, their twisted leaders ruling with an iron fist. They fought over the few remaining resources, their thirst for power and control driving them to madness.
      
      But there were those who refused to succumb to the chaos. They banded together, fighting for a better future and a chance to rebuild the world that had been lost. They were the rebels, the outcasts, the ones who refused to give up.
      
      As the years passed, the survivors adapted to their new world, learning to live and thrive in a place where the only rule was survival. And though the future was uncertain, they held on to hope, knowing that one day they would rise from the ashes and rebuild a better world.</div>
